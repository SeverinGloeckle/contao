# Known limitations

## Cache blocks scheduled publishing

If elements are to be published time-controlled and the shared cache is active,
they will only be shown on the website after the cache has been purged.

## Importing style sheets with a media query

Although the internal style sheet editor will add an existing media query when
exporting a style sheet, the media query will not be re-imported.

## Models and database connections

The model registry currently only supports the main database connection. The
Contao framework supports opening additional database connections, however, you
cannot make models use them.

## Moving content elements as non-admin user

Non-admin users cannot copy or move content elements between different parent
types, e.g. from an article to a news item or from a news item to an event.
They can only copy or move elements from e.g. one article to another article.
